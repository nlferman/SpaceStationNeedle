This is a small demo of a game concept I came up with called Space Station Needle. The premise is a Reverse Metroidvania, where instead of starting with nothing and slowly building power, you start with everything and slowly give up power, in order to power up the space station you are in.


2D Side Top-Down Reverse Metroidvania. Reverse Metroidvania has player start off with full power and slowly give it up. Player will give up power ups to power up space station, which grants player access to new areas. Player starts at 100% completion with a goal of getting 0% completion. Different endings are unlocked based on player completion.

Enemies
Game will have two factions of enemies, machines and aliens. Machines will work together to hunt player and aliens. Aliens will attack machines and each other (if different species) as well as player. Machines will ignore player when they are at 25% or less in power-ups.

This game is puzzle, combat, and exploration focused. It uses a twin-stick Overhead shooter style of mechanics. Player controls movement with Left stick and aim direction with Right stick (or WASD and mouse on a PC). Player performs other actions such as jump, shoot, dash, etc. with other buttons.
